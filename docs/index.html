                    <strong>How do I get started?</strong>
                    <div>
                        To get started, click on the create food button and grow your population
                        until you get around to 20 or so. Then, with the gains from farmers, start 
                        increasing your production and making buildings. This will open up the doors
                        to culture &amp; faith. Start purchasing technologies as well to make the msot of it,
                        and keep exploring! Once your farmers are more optimized, you can begin diversifying
                        your citizenry.
